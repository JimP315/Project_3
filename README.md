## Purpose
The idea of this project is to develop a screener that identifies stocks listed on the NASDAQ market that are breaking their 52-week highs or lows and then, overlay the list with additional indicators to support decision making such as,

*   PE ratio
*   Momentum indicator
*   Sentiment score of recent news

## Caveat
This is certainly not meant to be a comprehensive investment model but simply act as a basic entry level tool for other users who may be interested to customise this application to suit their own individual needs.

## Future Enhancements
We will look at introducing a portfolio tracker for users to track the value of the assets and possibly include a Monte Carlo Simulation feature to project the future value of their investment.
